## How to run the game

After finish cloning the project. Right click the file "Launcer for only my PC.bat" and choose Edit. Then change the directory path of JavaFX library to the one in your PC. Save and double click this file again, done.

Or you can just easily use terminal in your pc to run with the command:

```
java -jar --module-path [Put your path to javaFX lib directory here] --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.controls,javafx.graphics,javafx.media TanksVSTrucks.jar
```

Before running the command, make sure that you're already in the same directory with the "TanksVSTrucks.jar". And don't forget to change the javaFX lib directory path.
